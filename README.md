# Admin-Panel

its an admin panel with 2 html files, one for login page and the other for your admin panel.
you enter a username and password and it will check them a list of username and passwords which is 
gathered through a fetch api and from a virtual json server (in the case there is a problem 
fetching the data, a list of usernames and passwords would be replaced offline and only in order to let you test this panel)

in the panel page, there are many different topics which should be filled using a database (which is not set), but one of these topics
is developed offline just as an example of how they would look like.
this example topic is about products and you can add new items for your online service (say a shopping website) and also see a list
of addet and avaialble items which also could be filled with data gathere through database.
